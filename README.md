  _1. When the user inputs a number, the program will return all the numbers before that number, starting at 1.
    ex. 2 -> "1, 2"

  2. When the program would return a number divisible by 3, it instead returns "ping".
    ex. 3 -> "1, 2, ping"

  3. When the program would return a number divisible by 5, it instead returns "pong".
    ex. 5 -> "1, 2, ping, 4, pong".

  4. When a number is divisible by 3 and 5, program returns "ping pong!".
    ex. 15 -> "1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7, 8, ping, pong, 11, ping, 13, 14, ping pong!"_
